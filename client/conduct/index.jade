            All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our event* are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.
            tl;dr: Be nice.

            ### The Short Version
            Our event is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, veteran status, national origin, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without travel reimbursement or a refund at the discretion of the event organizers*.

            ### The Less Short Version
            Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, veteran status, national origin, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

            Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

            If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.
            If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately. Event staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts.

            Event staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

            We expect participants to follow these rules at event and workshop venues and event-related social events. We have a zero-tolerance policy on harassment. If you see anything that makes you uncomfortable or that you believe is making other hackers uncomfortable, you should disclose that to the event organizers in a responsible manner.*

            *Changes have been made to reflect specific status of Bitcamp as an event, not a conference, to include travel reimbursement into the concept of refunds, and to stipulate our zero-tolerance policy on harassment.
